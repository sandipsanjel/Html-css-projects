          <h2>Maharajadhiraj P N Shah</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Prithvi Narayan Shah</b> was born prematurely on 11 January 1723
            as the first child of Nara Bhupal Shah and Kaushalyavati Devi in the
            Gorkha Palace.[11][12] Idols of PrithviNarayan Shah with his two
            wives Prince Prithvi Narayan Shah's education began at age five
            through the appropriate ceremony. At that time, the responsibility
            to educate him was given to Mokchyeshwor Aryal and Bhanu Aryal, They
            were the Upadhyayas who worked in the palace as astrologers, where
            they were also known as Jyotishi or Jaisi[citation needed]. Even
            though the Gurus provided his primary education, the duty of
            developing his character was taken by Queen Chandra
            Pravawati[citation needed]. It is said that seeing the prince of
            neighboring states Tanahun, Lamjung, and Kaski indulged in excess
            pleasure, Chandra Pravawati kept Prithvi Narayan Shah away from
            pleasurable and wrong pursuits. That is why no traces of pleasurable
            pursuits and diversion can be found in his early life.
